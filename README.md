## My process

First of all i added the basic html tags required for the design.
I added two div tags to the template provided and named their class.
Then I added the qr image and a heading tag and a paragraph tag.

After this, I moved to styling for which i created an external style.css file
and began styling.

With the reference of desktop-design image, i tried to produce the
same result as far as i could see.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

this box shadow property was a little confusing. But i have learned it now. first value is horizontal offset and
second value is vertical offset. Other optional value are blur and spread and also color.

```css
box-shadow: 5px 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
```

### Continued development

I need to learn box shadows property in detail.
And also optimize a lot of my css stylings.
